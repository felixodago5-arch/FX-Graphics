In my Bus topology design, I used a hub instead of a switch because a hub best represents how data is transmitted in a traditional bus network. In a bus topology, all devices share the same communication medium, and any signal sent by one device is broadcast to all others. The hub performs this same function in Packet Tracer by forwarding data to every connected PC. A switch, on the other hand, directs data only to the intended destination device, which represents a star topology rather than a bus.
